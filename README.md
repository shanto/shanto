## 👋 Hi there!

I'm Shaan, a versatile tech enthusiast with a background in DevOps engineering and full-stack software development. My toolkit is as diverse as my interests, spanning languages and frameworks from C, C++, Python, Django, Node, React, NextJS, Electron, Cordova - and that's just scratching the surface! What really sets my heart racing? Diving into the depths of GitHub, searching for hidden gems - those abandoned yet potentially game-changing projects just waiting to be revived. It's not just a hobby; it's my way of contributing to the open-source community and breathing new life into forgotten code.
